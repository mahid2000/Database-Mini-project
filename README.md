# Database-Mini-project
CS2855: Databases Mini Project

This mini-project covers some of the notions covered in class and lab tutorials for the CS2855: Databases module. The assessed learning outcomes are a correct usage and understanding of SQL via the JDBC library.

REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PROGRAM:

Initialising a connection to the postgres server
1. The program should ask the user for his/her username and password, and connect to the correct database based on this username and passwords. So please DON’T hard code your own username, or your own database name and password inside the program code. The reason is that we need to test it on our own database. The connection to the postgreSQL server is then done in the same way shown in Lab 7, using appropriatly the arguments passed to the program.
Reading/writing tables in the databases
2. The program should check if the tables (and possibly views) it creates already exist in the database, and only if they do, drop them before their creation. For tables you can simply do:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <table-name>
Reading the delayedFlights and airport files
The delayedFlights file available on moodle is a file with the following format:

 Each line in delayedFlights consists of a record about a delayed flight.
The attributes are as follows:
ID_of_Delayed_Flight, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, DepTime, ScheduledDepTime, ArrTime, ScheduledArrTime, 
UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, ActualFlightTime, scheduledFlightTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay, Orig, Dest, Distance
The attributes’ meaning are self explanatory.
The airport file available on Moodle lists US Airports, sorted by Airport Code, with the format being:
airportCode, airportName, City, State.
3. The program now should read the two files, delayedFlights and airport above, and insert the information it reads to the database, in an appropriate way that would suite the requirements below (namely, it should insert it to tables in the way suitable to answer the queries below).

4. Make sure that the basic primary keys and foreign keys are specified so that users cannot delete a record containing information referred to (implicitly) by another table.

THE QUERIES (70 marks in total)
The program should output some statistical information about the data it reads from the file, as described in what follows (in the same order they are listed).
When you are required to list a collection of records/attributes, you are meant to output them to the standard output, where each record is written in a new line.
After the program lists each of the clauses above, it should output section separators lines like “########### ith Query ########” to make the output easy to read.
If you are requested to list 5 elements/records and there are less than 5 such elements/records, the program should simply print as many as there are.
Query 1 (10 marks)
List the 5 distinct Unique Carriers (UniqueCarrier) that suffer the largest number of flight delays (either on arrival or on departure) and the number of delays they had in descending order (with respect to the number of delays).
Example of output:
################## 1st Query ###############
WN 5665
AA 809
B6 396
EV 330
UA 252
Query 2 (10 marks)
List the top 5 distinct cities in which departure delays occur the most (irrespective of the length of the delay) in descending order (with respect to number of delays).
Example of output:
################## 2nd Query ###############
Chicago 752
Las Vegas 695
Dallas 425
Los Angeles 375
Phoenix 358
Query 3 (15 marks)
List the 2nd to 6th distinct destinations (Dest) that has the highest total amount of minutes in arrival delays (ArrDelay) in descending order (with respect to total arrival delay minutes), together with their total arrival delay minutes. Namely, if we denote the six distinct
destinations with the highest total arrival delay minutes by a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, then the program should output a2, a3 ,a4 ,a5 ,a6 (together with the total arrival delay minutes for each destination, as shown in the example below).
Example of output:
################## 3rd Query ###############
ORD 16073
OAK 13655
LAX 13617
PHX 12817
SAN 11121
Query 4 (15 marks)
For every state that has at least 10 airports, list the state and the number of the airports.

Query 5 (20 marks)
List the top 5 distinct states in which a flight between different airports within the same state has been delayed (either in arrival or departure) by descending order with respect to number of such delays (irrespective of the length of the delay), together with the number of such delays (you can assume that no flight has both origin and destination the same airport, and that every occurrence of a line in the delayedFlight file records a delay in either departure or arrival).
